 This is a frontend weather application that uses an API to retrieve weather data for specified locations. The application includes the ability to see the temperatures in either farenheit or celsius, the ability to get the weather in your location with just a click, the ability to enter a location and get weather data, the ability to see the weather conditions at the location, and includes a 5-day forecast for the location.
 
This project was created as a part of the SheCodes program.
